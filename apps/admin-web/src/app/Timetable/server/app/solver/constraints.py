"""
Constraint implementations for the timetable solver.

This module contains all hard and soft constraints as individual functions.
Each constraint function:
- Accepts: model, variables, solver_input, period data
- Returns: None (adds constraints directly) or slack variables (soft constraints)
- Checks toggle state from constraints config

Hard Constraints (must be satisfied):
- Teacher single assignment
- Section single subject per period
- Max consecutive periods
- Subject weekly load requirements
- Block period integrity
- Resource capacity
- Teacher availability
- Substitution reserve

Soft Constraints (preferences to optimize):
- Core subjects in morning
- Teacher load balance
- Minimize schedule gaps
- Subject distribution

    Language Block Synchronization Constraint.

    This constraint ensures that language teachers who share sections can be
    scheduled at the same time slots across their shared sections. This enables
    "language blocks" where students split into groups (Hindi, Kannada, Sanskrit)
    and each group goes to a different teacher simultaneously.

    IMPORTANT: This does NOT mean all 3 languages are taught to the same section
    at the same time. Instead, it ensures that the language teachers teaching
    the SAME SET of sections can have their periods aligned.

    For example, if T016 (Hindi), T019 (Kannada), T022 (Sanskrit) all teach
    sections 6A and 6B, we want to enable scheduling them at the same periods
    so students can be split into language groups.

    The constraint works by:
    1. Finding language teacher "sets" that share the same sections
    2. For each set, ensuring that if one language is scheduled for a section,
       the other languages CAN be scheduled for that section at the same time
       (but don't HAVE to be - they just need teachers available)

    This is a SOFT synchronization - it allows but doesn't force language blocks.
    The strict version that forces all languages simultaneously is too restrictive.
