# Two-Phase Solver Implementation — Change Report

Date: 2026-01-26

This document details the implementation of the Two-Phase Solver with automatic constraint relaxation, result caching with persistence, and comprehensive diagnostics.

---

## Executive Summary

Implemented a complete overhaul of the timetable solver to guarantee feasibility when mathematically possible:

- **Two-Phase Architecture**: Phase 1 (40% time) finds ANY valid solution; Phase 2 (60% time) optimizes
- **Automatic Relaxation**: When Phase 1 fails, HARD_RELAXABLE constraints are relaxed in priority order
- **Cache Invalidation Fix**: Input hash now includes solver version to prevent stale results
- **Dual Persistence**: Results saved to both Redis cache AND disk (data/results/)
- **Capacity Analysis**: Pre-flight check detects capacity issues before expensive solving

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Two-Phase Solver (`two_phase_solver.py`)

Complete rewrite implementing the solving pipeline:

```
Input → Capacity Analysis → Phase 1 (Feasibility) → [Auto-Relaxation] → Phase 2 (Optimization) → Result
```

**Key Functions:**

- `analyze_capacity(solver_input)` - Pre-flight capacity check
- `compute_input_hash(solver_input)` - Deterministic hashing with SOLVER_VERSION
- `TwoPhaseSolver.solve(time_limit, deadline)` - Main entry point
- `TwoPhaseSolver._solve_phase1()` - Feasibility phase
- `TwoPhaseSolver._solve_phase2(baseline)` - Optimization phase
- `TwoPhaseSolver._solve_with_relaxation()` - Auto-relaxation loop

**Time Allocation:**
- Phase 1: 40% of available time (min 15s)
- Phase 2: 60% of available time (min 15s)
- Relaxation attempts: 30% of Phase 1 time each

**Result Structure:**
```json
{
  "status": "FEASIBLE|OPTIMAL|INFEASIBLE",
  "timetable": {...},
  "teacher_schedules": {...},
  "meta": {
    "input_hash": "...",
    "solver_version": "2.0.0-two-phase",
    "phase1_time_sec": 24.5,
    "phase2_time_sec": 35.2,
    "total_time_sec": 59.7,
    "solver_pipeline": "two_phase"
  },
  "relaxation_info": {
    "success": true,
    "relaxed_constraints": ["..."],
    "relaxed_count": 0,
    "iterations": 1
  },
  "capacity_analysis": {
    "capacity_ratio": 1.85,
    "is_sufficient": true,
    "num_teachers": 35,
    "num_classes": 6
  }
}
```

### 2. Constraint Classification (`constraint_types.py`)

Added new types:

```python
class SolvePhase(Enum):
    PHASE1_FEASIBILITY = "phase1_feasibility"
    PHASE1_RELAXATION = "phase1_relaxation"
    PHASE2_OPTIMIZATION = "phase2_optimization"

@dataclass
class RelaxationResult:
    success: bool
    relaxed_constraints: List[str]
    iterations: int
    final_status: str
```

**Constraint Categories:**
- `HARD_CORE`: Never relaxed (teacher_single_assignment, section_single_subject, subject_frequency)
- `HARD_RELAXABLE`: Can be relaxed in priority order (language_sync → weekly_balance)
- `SOFT`: Optimization objectives only

### 3. Configuration (`config.py`)

New settings:

```python
SOLVER_VERSION = os.getenv("SOLVER_VERSION", "2.0.0-two-phase")
RESULTS_DIR = DATA_DIR / "results"
DEADLINE_BUFFER_SECONDS = int(os.getenv("DEADLINE_BUFFER_SEC", "30"))
```

### 4. Result Persistence (`redis_queue.py`)

Added dual persistence:

```python
def persist_result_to_file(self, job_id: str, result: Dict) -> Optional[str]:
    """Persist result to disk for durability."""

def store_result_by_hash(self, input_hash: str, result: Dict) -> None:
    """Store result indexed by input hash (Redis + file)."""
```

Results are now saved to:
- `data/results/job_{job_id}.json` - Job-indexed
- `data/results/hash_{input_hash[:16]}.json` - Hash-indexed

### 5. Cache Invalidation Fix

The stale cache bug was fixed by including `SOLVER_VERSION` in the input hash:

```python
def compute_input_hash(solver_input: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    hash_input = {
        "solver_version": SOLVER_VERSION,  # Key fix
        "school": solver_input.get("school", {}),
        "teachers": solver_input.get("teachers", []),
        # ...
    }
    return hashlib.sha256(canonical_json.encode()).hexdigest()
```

When solver code changes, `SOLVER_VERSION` is bumped, invalidating all cached results.

### 6. Worker Logging (`worker.py`)

Enhanced with structured log markers:

```
[JobQueued] job_id=abc123
[Phase1Start] Starting feasibility phase
[Phase1Result] Completed in 24.50s, feasible=True
[ConstraintsRelaxed] language_sync
[Phase2Start] Starting optimization phase
[Phase2End] Completed in 35.20s
[SolverResult] FEASIBLE in 59.70s
[ResultCached] hash=a1b2c3...
[JobCompleted] status=FEASIBLE, solve_time=59.70s
```

### 7. Result Retrieval (`result.py`)

Enhanced endpoints:

- `GET /result/{job_id}` - Returns result with metadata
- `GET /result/{job_id}/full` - Returns complete job record

Added file-based fallback:
```python
def _load_result_from_file_by_hash(input_hash: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Load result from file by input hash."""
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Demo Case (6 classes, 35 teachers)

✅ **MUST produce FEASIBLE or OPTIMAL status**

With 35 teachers and 6 classes, there is surplus capacity. The two-phase solver will:
1. Pass capacity analysis (ratio > 1.0)
2. Find feasibility in Phase 1
3. Optimize in Phase 2
4. Return valid timetable

### Stale Cache Invalidation

✅ **Changing constraints produces new result**

Input hash includes:
- Solver version
- School configuration
- Teacher/class/subject data
- **Constraints configuration**

Any change produces a different hash → fresh solve.

### Persistence

✅ **Results survive Redis restart**

Results are written to both:
- Redis (fast cache)
- `data/results/` directory (durable)

Retrieval checks both sources.

## Verification

Run the verification script:

```bash
./tools/verify_demo_case.sh
```

This script:
1. Checks server is running
2. Submits solve request with sample data
3. Polls for completion
4. Validates result status (FEASIBLE/OPTIMAL)
5. Checks timetable was generated
6. Reports relaxed constraints if any
7. Verifies file persistence

### Run Tests

```bash
cd server
pytest app/solver/tests/test_two_phase_solver.py -v
```

Key test cases:
- `test_surplus_teachers_always_solves` - Primary acceptance criterion
- `test_no_soft_constraints_still_solves` - HARD_CORE only
- `test_different_constraints_different_hash` - Cache invalidation
- `test_teachers_can_have_free_periods` - Not over-constrained

---

## Notes and Next Steps

### Known Limitations

1. **Phase 2 warm start**: Currently rebuilds model; could pass solution hints
2. **Parallel solving**: Only uses CP-SAT's internal parallelism
3. **Large schools**: May need time limit > 120s for 40+ classes

### Future Enhancements

1. **Incremental solving**: Modify existing timetable rather than full re-solve
2. **Constraint debugging**: Interactive mode to identify conflicting constraints
3. **Solution hints**: Pass Phase 1 solution as hints to Phase 2
4. **Distributed solving**: Split by grade/section for parallel processing
