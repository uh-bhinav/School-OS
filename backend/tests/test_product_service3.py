# tests/test_product_service3.py
"""
Integration Tests for Product Service - Security & Multi-Tenancy

Covers:
- School isolation (product list, create, update, delete)
- IDOR prevention
- Role-based access control
- Category relationship security
- SKU global uniqueness vs product name school-scoped uniqueness

Test Philosophy:
Security is NON-NEGOTIABLE. These tests verify that multi-tenant boundaries
are strictly enforced and no data leakage occurs between schools.

CRITICAL PATTERNS FOLLOWED:
1. Extract IDs BEFORE any commit() - prevents MissingGreenlet errors
2. Use instance-based service pattern - ProductService(db_session)
3. Refresh objects AFTER commit when needed
4. Re-fetch objects after rollback scenarios
5. Never use asyncio.run() inside async tests
6. Let test fixtures handle transaction lifecycle
